# Distributed DB

Distributed DB is a project designed to do realtime analysis of big data generated in a distributed way using python based simulator. We use Kafka server for buffering the information to the server. It is then aggragated and displayed via bootstrap.
We use node.js for CDN hosting and angular.js and d3.js for realtime display.
SQL is used for storing aggragated data
